# Bubble teas

## functional paradigm
Bubble tea uses the elm programming paradign to lay out the code.
What happens within the Elm program though? It always breaks into three parts:

    * Model — the state of your application
    * View — a way to turn your state into HTML
    * Update — a way to update your state based on messages
